                Hello, everyone My name is Anran Yu, you can call me Ann. I'm from China. Now I live in Ottawa.I came to Algonquin College in January of this year and started my EAP course. Now I have joined the major of Interactive Media Design. In China, the media industry is developing and progressing at the fastest speed. At first, I just noticed that most of the traditional brochures turned into mobile web pages or computer web pages. Later, short videos also replaced other traditional promotional methods. My life is almost surrounded by short videos of all kinds, and I find it more and more interesting. Therefore, I chose Interactive Media Design as my major. I will graduate in 2022. I think I will go back to China and become a video editor.

                I have many hobbies. I like singing very much. I used to have a band and we used to play in some bars. But then everyone got their own jobs, so there was less time to rehearse songs and fewer performances. But that didn't stop me from loving music. I think if I really like it, my stage is everywhere, even in the bathtub. For work, animator is very attractive to me, but it is too difficult for me, because I don't have any foundation of painting. My love for animation comes from Disney. I have been fond of watching Disney animation since Childhood. The level of Chinese animation 20 years ago was not good, so when I saw Disney animation for the first time, I was surprised. I've loved it ever since. Disney was a childhood dream for me, and being an animator is a dream for me now. I also like travelling very much. I used to like to travel as long as I had a holiday. I like it very much both in the big city and in the small country. In my eyes, big cities represent effort and hope, while small villages represent relaxation and enjoyment. In the future, I will travel to more places to see different scenery and experience different life. This is fun!

                I think the most challenging thing in this course is that my English is not very good. When I want to express more things, I may only say a very short sentence. I am constantly learning and learning about Canadian culture. I hope my English will be better and better in the future! Thank you very much!
